Human needs and motivations are to some extent the secret to living a good life. The most famous map of human motivation is Maslow's Hieratchy of Needs (henceforth MHNs). MHNs separate human needs into 5 categories each predicated on the last, there are:

This is pretty intuitive, however before printing it out and putting in on my wall I decided to poke around and see what other philosophers (and their intellectual offspring sociologists and psychologists) have to say about MHNs. The standard issues of psychology once again formed the main critques. MHNs was formed observations (not empirically/scientifically tested), meaning it is subject to researcher and cultural bias. Other's said the model is an oversimplification, saying that human motivation is too amorphous and complex issue that words and models could never fully encapsulate; a fine but lazy critique. The other main critique was the static nature of the model, as each of these levels are not necessarily predicated on each other. There are starving artists who achieve self actualisation and esteem, unemployed and unhoused with legendary love stories and so on. While critiquing the rigidity of the model is fair, I think he does, in general, give a good layout for how most people do approach their human needs. The Academic community, including Maslow,heard these critiques are slotted in 3 more levels to his hierachy, cognitive, asthetic and transcendental turining it MHNs into:

That looks very good, still the static issue is there, but I think we can just imagine it as more of a tree, once you get past the first 2 the next 3 can kind of be done asynchronously, before moving to steps 7 and 8 which may be the same thing. Interestingly enough this, although I thought it was an original thought, is ERG theory. The ERG theory, developed by Clayton Alderfer, is an alternative to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. Alderfer condensed Maslow's five levels of needs into three categories: Existence, Relatedness, and Growth (ERG). To break those down.

While there are other's that form turn this hierarchy into more complex matrices, I think this general model stands as quite a good guide for human nature.

Agian sorry for the poor writing I am in a rush to get the weekly in.
