I have been religiously using [obsidian](obsidian.md) for the past year or two now. While I love almost everything about it the one problem that has never escaped my mind is how do I organise the folders for my notes. 

With the graph view, I can see how files relate to each on another by how they are linked. This is fine for a smaller notes but as my vault grows to over 4000 notes, the graph itself becomes to messy to search through. Therefore I go back to the traditional organisational structure with files in folders and subfolders. These are much less versatile in terms of how relationships can be displayed as the relationship is one to many as opposed to many to many. This is easy when doing this just for something like biology, where the word taxonomy comes from, but extending that to all human knowledge becomes a little difficult. For example, where does Aristotle go, is he slotted in as a figure of philosophy, or of biology or astronomy or politics or just a prominent figure in macedonian history. Are all historical figures just placed in folders representing their time, or are they linked to folders of their ideas.  

While there is a whole field of philosophy dedicated to just that, I have just been learning a lot about early enlightenment science and wanted to put away Kant and a priori rationalisation for a while and go back to the methods of Isaac Newton and Francis Bacon. So I will take the _Hypotheses non fingo_ attitude and try and empirically find the root of all knowledge. I do want to note that this essay is at core a comparisons of these to forms of epistemology. Is the empirical method better than the rationalists, where should each be applied etc. 

Where can I find all knowledge? Wikipedia of course. Wikipedia works exactly how obsidian does, say we are taking an article about Sir Francis Bacon, well in the story of his life there are many related topics that aries, such as his book _The New Atlantis_ or his cause of death _pneumonia_. In the document itself these files will be linked as such: lorem ipsum \[\[New Atlantis]], died from \[\[pneumonia]]. What we can do then is go through that document and look scrape for those links, we can then repeat this for all of wikipedia and in count up the most frequently mentioned articles. In theory then we will find the roots of knowledge and create a taxonomy for all of knowledge based on that. 

# Method
To do this I started off by going [here](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/) to wikidumps and downloading all of wikipedia, you would be suprised to find that this is only a 20gb zip file that turns into a 90gb XML file when fully decompressed.

With this messy data I did a preliminary sweep with this little slice of regex  `\[\[(.*?)\]\]` to extract all words rapped in \[\[ ]]. When I first ran this code my computer died trying to load 90 gb or data into 16GB of RAM. I fixed this by reading only a million lines at the time and writing the extracted data to a txt file before moving onto the next. This took about an hour to do with 12 Gen I7-1260P.

After that I had a 20gb file of strings stored in a `.txt` file, but some of them are a bit weird here is an example of what the data looked like at that point.


<br>

```cs
Imperial cult  
File:Imperial Seal of Japan.svg|thumb|right|120px|[[Imperial Seal of Japan|Japanese Imperial kamon  
chrysanthemum  
Gukanshō  
Richard Ponsonby-Fane|Ponsonby-Fane, Richard Arthur Brabazon  
Isaac Titsingh|Titsingh, Isaac.  
Nihon Ōdai Ichiran  
H. Paul Varley|Varley, H. Paul.  
Emperor Kanmu
```

After doing more regex to remove the data after the `|` and any line that had 'File:' on it I had about a 10 GB file of workable data. I then wrote a simple counting script and let it run for 20 min. When it finished I opened the file excited to see the answer to knowledge but instead saw this.

<br>

```json
wp:aes: 2991227

```

Disappointed I put in a little more regex and was finlay left with a GB long file with the secrets to the organisation of all knowledge.

So what did I find well you can look through the data yourself [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xqywfPbgk_bEUqD0WYvkQRxEhte54f66/view?usp=sharing), but as a sneak peak here are the top 50:

Yeah that did not do what I wanted it to do. This data are still pretty interesting to look through to see the bias and hot spots topics of wikipedia but does not give us the fundamental taxonomy of all knowledge. 

There is obviously a lot of bias with this being a community driven repository of knowledge written in English, we are going to get `united states` and `france` (why?) near the top. What I do find very interesting that I forgot to filter out the users that show up, such as `user talk:gene93k: 189642`, `user talk:anomiebot: 101019` and `user talk:coibot: 97764`. While I really should have removed these strings from that dataset, I want to keep it up there so they we have a record that these people (or are they people??) have more sway than the idea of `race`, most countries and ironically `genus`. It also makes you wonder how much power these people actually have in swaying what humanity understands as fact. Pretty scary.

So what have we learnt, either wikipedia is just a bad dataset and I need to repeat this test on something like JSTOR - at risk of becoming Aaron Swartz 2.0 - or empiricism (baconian) is just not the right process for looking at the structure of knowledge. As I don't want to get arrested I am going to say I made an epistemological error. It seems like I'm going to have to go back to Kant and do some rational a priori analysis then. Still this was fun.

All my speget code for this project will be available on my [github](https://github.com/TheArctesian/Wikipedia-Knowledge-Taxonomy), it really is shit speget code, you can go to the wikidumps link above if you want to replicate this experiment.
