This is a term I am quite found of, it means (to me) breaking apart culture to it's root components, removing all the abstractions and obfuscations and showing the world for how silly it is. I think I will start identifying with it.

I am coming back to this note and I do feel like it has new meaning. As Aristotle reminds us classifying `phenomena x` with the quality of a binary extreme is a vice, the middle way or the mean is the path to virtue. Societies are not often right, but for some things, the natural course of history may be better at finding the mean than my measly little brain.

EDIT: Reading this back Jun 13th 2025 holy fuck wow this is really where my little brain began to be a critical theorist.
