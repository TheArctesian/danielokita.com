# Note on the Text

This writing style is a little scary for me; it's very disclosing. Up to this point, I have not found my own voice in writing—maybe I still haven't. I have been trying to write for an audience I only think I know. This is how I write in my journal and wish to write, at least presently. As this is my website, I do what I want, and you can get to know me better.

If anyone reads this and has concerns over my mental health, firstly thank you, secondly I am fine. I make my bed in the morning(ish), I go to classes(ish), I get my shit done(ish), and I am content(ish) with life. I am not going mad(ish). That last one is a joke, but I will be writing a piece on the Mad Philosophers or those who went mad: Diogenes, Crates, Nietzsche, Pythagoras, and so on.

This is meant to be critique and art combined, I don't know if this is possible to read unless you occupy my mind, but I wish to represent myself without obfuscation.

This is a mostly secular essay, though allusion to Abrahamic faith is there. I have not invented/found a good enough vernacular to talk about these ideas outside of these traditions (at least in English).

Without further ado, let's rebuild the link between humanity with reality.

# REVELATION MUST BE DEFENDED

The deepest root of knowledge finds 3 branches: perception, reflection, and revelation. I argue not for revelation's rational validity, only for its integrity. Revelation is the communication of souls, the dance of cosmic resonance. We don't know reason; its shadows are revealed to us, but its shape is an illusion. Fuck Nick Land. Society and Vitality MUST BE DEFENDED. We are wise because we know nothing but the imminent.

I ask you to not respond with words but with feeling. Allow revelation to colour your soul. Don't let power shut your eyes to the transcendental. Fear entropy, spit on order. Embody reality; it waits for you. Cling onto its soothing whispers. Peer into the world soul, see it in ART, in NATURE, in G_D, in LOVE. Tempt the limboing ego, dare to feel. Stare into the diminishing abysses of infinity; don't let it run away.

Experience reality with all the passion our corporeal form allows us to. DARE TO FEEL!

Bathe in the lucidity of its love, listen to the harmony of its dissonance. Embody the psychedelic phronesis, glimpse into the universe beyond dimensionality. This is knowledge.

This knowledge is universal yet we have yet to invent the epistemic tools to confer it, apart from art. Concrete ways of capturing its beauty are impossible, only through embodying it, through interacting with it can we know it.

That knowledge is fundamental, it's the teleology of necessity, of univocity. It is the chorus (not course) of nature's serenade. It brushes that fundamental of good, that of expanding relations, the seemingly futile fight against entropy.

Beyond good and evil we see it, pleasure simply does not belong in the same ontological category. We feel it, it is a connection beyond survival, the final lock on the chain binding us from God's embrace.

Its divinity is blinding, like something that mere mortals were never meant to see. That which the minute of knowledge hid away from us. As Nietzsche wrote: "In some remote corner of the sprawling universe, twinkling among the countless solar systems, there was once a star on which some clever animals invented knowledge. It was the most arrogant, most mendacious minute in world history, but it was only a minute."

I leave you to ponder on these aphorisms.

"The Law of God is written in our hearts." - Romans 2:15  
"We will show them Our signs in the horizons and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that it is the truth." - Quran 41:53  
"The Dao that can be told is not the eternal Dao." - Lao Zi, Dao De Jing  
"What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence." - Ludwig Wittgenstein
