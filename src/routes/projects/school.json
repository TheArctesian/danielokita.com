This app allowed students to easily see their flexi schedule and make changes. I no longer host or the domain, the app is being hosted by the school now (i think). The link goes to the github. There was a second iteration of this where I replaced the entire backend with a Go server called flexi2.",

We didn't win, but it was fun to work to do extraterrestrial networking and electrical engineering. We had a team of 7 but really only 2 of us did any work. A funny story was the submission that won the popular vote (based on instagram likes) was a satellite that would send ashes up to space. This was a well built satellite but they somehow did not consider Newton's third law, when the ashes release they would set the satellite containing many other cubesats off course.",

The project features pseudorandom generation based on user-provided seeds, interactive gameplay mechanics, and a custom rendering system with heads-up display (HUD). Built with a robust architecture supporting state persistence, deterministic behaviors, and room connectivity validation through graph traversal algorithms, ensuring every generated world provides a coherent, navigable space.
